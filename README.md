# Project Charter

## Core Principles

### Open Source

Battery Pulse is commited to offering its platform under a free, perpetually licensed model. We are committed to fostering an environment where the global battery community—spanning government, academia, and industry—can come together to share insights, innovations, and best practices. Our open source philosophy ensures that Battery Pulse remains scalable, extensible, and universally accessible. By cultivating a broad network of contributors and partners, we guarantee that our platform evolves continually, driven by a collective commitment to advancing renewable energy technologies.

### Cloud Native

Battery Pulse is architected to be cloud native, utilizing the principles of modern software design to ensure scalability and reliability across different environments. Our platform can be deployed seamlessly on any cloud infrastructure. This approach enables rapid scaling, easier management, and more robust disaster recovery processes. Whether you are dealing with large-scale data or need high availability, our cloud-native architecture supports your evolving needs.

### Extensible

At the heart of Battery Pulse's design philosophy is extensibility. We understand that the needs of the battery community are diverse and ever-changing. Therefore, our platform is built to allow users to easily add new functionalities, integrate with existing systems, and customize workflows. Through a well-documented API and a modular design, developers can plug in new algorithms, connect to various data sources, and build custom applications that enhance their analytical capabilities. This makes Battery Pulse not just a tool but a versatile framework that grows with your requirements.
