# Project Charter

Welcome to the Battery Pulse Project Charter—our vision for advancing battery technology through collaborative innovation. We're building a robust, cloud-native platform committed to open-source principles, designed to meet the needs of the global community. Join us in shaping a sustainable future, one contribution at a time.

## Core Principles

### Open Source

Battery Pulse is commited to fostering an environment where the global battery community—spanning government, academia, and industry—can come together to share insights, innovations, and best practices. Our open source philosophy ensures that Battery Pulse remains scalable, extensible, and universally accessible. By cultivating a broad network of contributors and partners, we guarantee that our platform evolves continually, driven by a collective commitment to advancing renewable energy technologies.

### Cloud Native

Battery Pulse is architected to be cloud native, utilizing the principles of modern software design to ensure scalability and reliability across different environments. Our platform can be deployed seamlessly on any cloud infrastructure. This approach enables rapid scaling, easier management, and more robust disaster recovery processes. Whether you are dealing with large-scale data or need high availability, our cloud-native architecture supports your evolving needs.

### Extensible

At the heart of Battery Pulse's design philosophy is extensibility. We understand that the needs of the battery community are diverse and ever-changing. Therefore, our platform is built to allow users to easily add new functionalities, integrate with existing systems, and customize workflows. Through a modular design, developers can plug in new algorithms, connect to various data sources, and build custom applications that enhance their analytical capabilities. This makes Battery Pulse not just a tool but a versatile framework that grows with your requirements.

## Software Architecture

### Distributed Data Processing
Battery Pulse leverages a robust, distributed data architecture designed to handle both real-time and batch data processing efficiently. At the core of our system is Apache Kafka, which serves as a high-throughput, fault-tolerant message broker. Kafka ingests data from various sources, including battery management systems (BMS), programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and battery cyclers, ensuring that all data is harmonized across a unified schema. This setup not only streamlines data ingestion but also enhances our platform's ability to manage large volumes of diverse data seamlessly.

### Scalable Data Storage and Analysis
Our platform employs Apache Spark for both streaming and batch processing, enabling rapid data analysis and decision-making capabilities. Spark's engine allows Battery Pulse to process data at scale, whether you are running a small lab or a large operation. For storage, we're leveraging open data formats, which implement ACID transactions over file storage. This approach enables organizations to host their data on object storeage—the most cost-competitive option on the market today.

### Deployment and Operations
Deployment of Battery Pulse is streamlined through Kubernetes. We include several Helm charts that leverage open-source operators to facilitate the deployment, scaling, and management of our applications in a cloud-native environment, ensuring reliability and minimizing operational overhead. Organizations may also opt to deploy the applications in this project using other services. Numerous external companies provide services for managed instances of Kafka or managed compute for Spark applications.

### Extensibility and Customization
Recognizing the diverse and evolving needs of the battery technology community, Battery Pulse is designed with extensibility at its foundation. Users can easily develop and integrate new producers, add Spark applications, and extend the platform's core functionalities. This modular architecture not only facilitates customization but also ensures that our platform can adapt to future challenges and opportunities in the rapidly advancing field of battery technology.
